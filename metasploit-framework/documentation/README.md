# Metasploit Developer Documentation

*(last updated December 1, 2014)

Metasploit is actively supported by a community of hundreds of
contributors and thousands of users world-wide. As a result, the
accompanying documentation moves quite quickly.

The best source of documentation on Metasploit development is
https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki. There are many
treasures there, such as:

  * [Evading Antivirus](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Evading-Anti-Virus)
  * [How Payloads Work](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/How-payloads-work)
  * [How to use Datastore Options](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/How-to-use-datastore-options)
  * [How to write browser exploits with BES](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/How-to-write-a-browser-exploit-using-BrowserExploitServer)
  * [How to write a bruteforcer](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/How-to-use-Msf%3A%3AAuxiliary%3A%3AAuthBrute-to-write-a-bruteforcer)

...and many, many more.
